          <h3>Raiders of the Lost Ark</h3>
          <p>Lucas conceived Raiders of the Lost Ark in the early 1970s. Seeking to modernize the serial films of the early 20th
            century, he developed the idea further with Kaufman, who suggested the Ark as the film's goal. Lucas eventually
            focused
            on developing his 1977 space opera Star Wars.</p>

          <h3>Temple of Doom</h3>
          <p>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was released on May 23, 1984, to financial success but initial reviews were
            mixed,
            criticizing its darker elements, strong violence and gore, as well as Capshaw's performance as Willie Scott; however,
            critical opinion has improved since 1984, citing the film's intensity and imagination.</p>

          <h3>The Last Crusade</h3>
          <p>After the mixed reaction to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Spielberg chose to lower the dark tone and graphic
          violence in the next installment. During the five years between The Temple of Doom and The Last Crusade, he and
          executive producer Lucas reviewed several scripts before accepting Jeffrey Boam's.</p>
